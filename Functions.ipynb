        "   - A Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code. Unlike compiled languages like C or C++, which are converted into machine code before execution, Python is an interpreted language. This means that the interpreter reads Python code, analyzes it, and executes it directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "   # 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "      - Predefined functions in Python are built-in functions that are provided by the Python language. They can be used to perform common tasks.\n",

        "# 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  - The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation, while lists are mutable and can be modified. Additionally, tuples are more memory-efficient compared to lists. Tuples can't be changed after they're created, but lists can be modified.\n",

For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.
